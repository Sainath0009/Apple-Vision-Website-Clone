# Apple Vision Pro Website Clone

ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to announce the completion of my latest web development project: an Apple Vision Pro website clone. This project was an incredible learning journey, and I'm proud of the results. Using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ScrollTrigger, and GSAP, I've created a visually appealing and highly interactive website.

- **Smooth Animations**: Leveraging the power of GSAP, I've implemented fluid animations that enhance the user experience and bring the site to life.
- **Interactive Scrolling Effects**: With ScrollTrigger, the site responds dynamically to user scrolling, creating an engaging and immersive browsing experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

I invite you all to check out the project and see these features in action: [Apple Vision Pro Website Clone](https://sainath0009.github.io/Apple-Vision-Website-Clone/)
